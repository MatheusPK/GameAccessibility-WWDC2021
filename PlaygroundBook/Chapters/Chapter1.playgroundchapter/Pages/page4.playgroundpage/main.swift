 # Face Tracking Technology
 This playground uses face tracking technology from apple, this interaction was just an example of what this technology allows us to do.
 With it we can greatly expand the amount of interactions within apps, especially when it comes to accessibility.
 This feature allows people who for some reason cannot use their hands or voice to interact with the device, to be able to use them fully, games are just one of the possibilities.
 
 I am very excited about this technology and all the benefits that it can bring in terms of accessibility, I will definitely use it in my future projects.
