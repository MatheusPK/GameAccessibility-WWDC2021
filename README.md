My project focuses on showing Apple's Face Tracking technology, which allows a camera to recognize and map facial expressions like blinking and opening your mouth.

My playground tells the story of tyrannosaurus Alfredo who just got an iPad. However, as it has very short arms, it cannot interact with the iPad.

In Playground Book, you teach Alfredo to use facial gestures, and
then there's a mini-game where you use these gestures to help Alfredo use the iPad and rescue the dinosaur eggs scattered across the screen.
